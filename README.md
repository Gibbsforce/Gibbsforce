### Hi! I am Alvaro.

- ðŸ‘‹ I'm trying to turn my hobby as a job.
- ðŸ‘€ I started with C, C++ and Java but right know I'm a fullstack web developer using mainly JavaScript, React as frontend and Express in Node as backend. I've also used PHP and Python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust and Go for backend because I want to focus only on backend development.
